## RDM4Mic - Research Data Management for Microscopy

Initiated by Susanne Kunis (CellNanOs, Osnabrueck), Stefanie Weidtkamp-Peters (CAi, Duesseldorf) and Astrid Strauss (CECAD, Cologne), this group started its work in 2019 and deals with the topic of research data management for microscopy ([overview](https://github.com/German-BioImaging/RDM4mic/blob/master/presentations/Rdm4mic_landscape_elmi2021.pdf)). Presently the group has 47 members from different institutions.

The meetings are about:

- Strategies for image data management
- Requirements and resources needed to set up a local image repository
- Available software, tools, workflows and standards
- Handling of change management
